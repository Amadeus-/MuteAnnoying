### Mutes sounds from [Mute Annoying WoW Sounds](https://www.curseforge.com/wow/addons/mute-wow-sounds) by Kiingy
* In Patch 8.2.0 you can't replace sounds anymore by placing a file in the Sound\ folder, they can now only be muted with [MuteSoundFile](https://wow.gamepedia.com/API_MuteSoundFile)(FileDataID).
* Initially generated by [MuteAnnoying-Converter](https://github.com/ketho-wow/MuteAnnoying-Converter).
* Open for pull requests.
